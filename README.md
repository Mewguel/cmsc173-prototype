# Setup

1. Clone the project `git clone https://github.com/abigailnadua/cmsc173-prototype.git`

2. Install dependencies using `yarn` or `npm i`

3. Start development server using `yarn start` or `npm run start`

4. Create a production build using `yarn build` or `npm run build`

# Development

1. Write your commit messages properly by including the feature that you added/fixed.

- Example: `added the navigation bar in home page`, `fixed a bug in the map page`

2. Create a branch each time you add a new feature/fixed a bug and name them correspondingly.

- Example: `home-page-navigation-bar`

3. Push the changes in the remote branch.

4. Create a new pull request from the working branch to its base branch. Inform the other members as soon as possible once the pull request has been created.

5. All members can merge the pull request but must inform other members first.
